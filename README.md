# Souren Sarkar 👋

**Builder at the intersection of AI + compliance + real estate tech.**  
Currently shipping a multi-tenant SaaS that turns messy regulatory docs into auditable, actionable workflows.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Veritiq**  
  - **Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript + MUI v5 (modular apps), FastAPI + Pydantic, PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy async + Alembic)  
  - **Platform themes:** operational compliance, loan-level QC/audits (mortgage banking), risk controls, evidence trails, policy-to-control mapping  
  - **AI workflows:** document ingestion → extraction → human-in-the-loop review/approval → versioning → audit-ready outputs  
  - **Architecture concerns:** multi-tenancy, authN/authZ (Cognito), RBAC/ABAC, observability, durable jobs/scheduling, evals/regression

- 🌱 I’m currently learning  
  - **LLM engineering:** RAG patterns, prompt/chain design, eval harnesses, precision/recall tradeoffs, hallucination containment  
  - **ModelOps:** drift detection (precision drift / confidence lift), critical regression, negative mining, release gates  
  - **Systems:** distributed job orchestration (Temporal), async execution (Celery/Redis), secure SaaS patterns and data isolation  
  - **Stats/ML:** *Introduction to Statistical Learning* (and gearing up for *Elements of Statistical Learning*)

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
  - **Document intelligence** (PDF → structured compliance data, grounded extraction, citations)  
  - **HITL design** (queues, reviewer UX, dispute resolution, training data capture)  
  - **Model quality tooling** (evals, regression suites, monitoring dashboards)  
  - **GRC/Compliance product engineering** (workflows, evidence, controls, audit trails)

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with  
  - Designing **high-signal evals** for extraction/classification tasks (including “critical regression” definitions)  
  - **Tenant-safe data architectures** (row-level security vs app-layer guards, leakage prevention)  
  - **Release processes** for models (rollouts, backfills, shadow runs, gating metrics)

- 💬 Ask me about  
  - Building SaaS with **React + FastAPI + Postgres**  
  - **Mortgage compliance/QC**, MISMO-style structured data thinking, audit evidence design  
  - LLM pipelines with **HITL**, and how to keep AI from “going off the rails” with contracts + validation

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like systems that are **boringly reliable**... and hobbies that are not (bird photography + electronics tinkering) 🦜🔧
